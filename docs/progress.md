### Step 01: Local Infrastructure Bootstrap

Status: local services running; health verification pending

Added:

- `.env.example` with local infrastructure defaults.
- `docker-compose.yml` for PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, and Mailpit.
- `Makefile` helpers for setup, up/down, logs, and reset.
- `docs/implementation-step-01-checklist.md`.

Verification:

- Docker CLI found inside `/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/docker`.
- Docker version: 27.5.1.
- Docker Compose version: v2.32.4-desktop.1.
- Docker Desktop was started, but this Codex session cannot access `/Users/karabin/.docker/run/docker.sock` due to sandbox permissions. Run `make up` from a normal terminal.
- First terminal run reached image pull, then failed because `docker-credential-desktop` was not in `PATH`. `Makefile` now prepends Docker Desktop's bundled bin directory.
- Next terminal run reached image pull and failed on `minio/minio` pull access denied. LocalStack latest then required license activation. Local S3 was switched to Adobe S3Mock for bootstrap continuity; this needs a D0 infra ADR before production-like environments.
- PostgreSQL 18 rejected the old `/var/lib/postgresql/data` mount layout. Compose now mounts the named volume at `/var/lib/postgresql`.

Remaining:

- Confirm PostgreSQL and Redis health become `healthy` with a second `make ps` after startup.
- Confirm S3Mock responds on `http://localhost:9090`.
- Confirm Mailpit UI opens on `http://localhost:8025`.
- Pin production image digests during D0/D1 compatibility work.
- Add Laravel backend, migrations, health endpoints, and CI in later D1 slices.

Terminal evidence:

- `make ps` showed `business-watchdog-mailpit-1`, `business-watchdog-postgres-1`, `business-watchdog-redis-1`, and `business-watchdog-s3-1` running.
- Published ports: PostgreSQL `5432`, Redis `6379`, S3Mock `9090`, Mailpit SMTP `1025`, Mailpit UI `8025`.
